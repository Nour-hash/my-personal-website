                <p>
                I am a passionate software developer specializing in full-stack development and project management. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Digital Communications at FH Campus Wien, I focus on AI and Mobile App Development. My practical experience includes leading a Django-based web application project for PR-Data GmbH, where I managed project timelines and delivered high-quality solutions.

                <p>
                As a freelancer, I develop dynamic websites and mobile apps using front-end and back-end frameworks like Angular and Node.js. Fluent in German, English, Arabic, and basic Japanese, I am adept at connecting with a global audience. I am committed to continuing my journey in software development, creating innovative solutions that drive progress.
